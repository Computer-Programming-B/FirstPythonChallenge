You will write a *very* short Python program  using Pythonâ€™s arithmetic operators to solve this first challenge. You may find slide 47 of the [Computer Programming B slide presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rICcmNbnGYsB-cV_6EatPyzcOS2sId80Jh2kayUzm4Q/edit?usp=sharing) helpful. If you get it correct, it will advance you to the next level. Submit the Python program you wrote to  the google classroom assignment.
