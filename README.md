You will write a *very* short program on repl.it using Pythonâ€™s arithmetic operators to try to solve this first challenge. You may find slides 23 - 26 of the [Computer Programming B slide presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rICcmNbnGYsB-cV_6EatPyzcOS2sId80Jh2kayUzm4Q/edit?usp=sharing) helpful. If you get it correct, it will advance you to the next level. Submit the Python program you wrote to solve the challenge by choosing *Share | Copy repl.it link* and adding the link to the google classroom assignment. If you have extra time, feel free to continue working through the challenges.
